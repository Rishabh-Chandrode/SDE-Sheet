## 1)N-th root of integer
        Apply binary search

## 2)Median of Row wise sorted matrix;
        low = min element in matrix
        high = max element in matrix
        apply binary search and find no of element <= mid

        for x to be median there will be (n/2) element less than x

## 3)Single element in a sorted array
        the first instance of every element is occurring on the even index and the second instance on the odd index.

## 4)Search in Rotated Sorted Array
        search for sorted array if target is not present in that array go for second array
