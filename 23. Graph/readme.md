## 1. Clone a Graph
        use map to store copy of nodes
        queue for bfs traversal

        using dfs
                if copy of currnode doesn't exist create new
                itterate on neighbor of curr node
                        if(copy present )
                                push back
                        else
                                recursion in curr

## 2) DFS Graph Traversal

## 3) BFS Graph Traversal

## 3.1) BFS detect cycle
        go from different paths if two paths colide with each other then it is a cycle

## 3.2)DFS detect cycle
        pass parent in parameter
