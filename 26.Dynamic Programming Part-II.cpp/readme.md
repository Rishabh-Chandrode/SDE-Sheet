## 1)Minimum Path Sum
    

## 5)Egg Droping Problem
        f(floor,egg) returns minimum no of attempts to find f;

        base Case:
            if one egg left we have to go through all the floors on by one
            if one floor left return 1
            if 0 floor left return 0

        check every floor and for every floor there will be two cases
            break: check for lower floors
            not break: check for upper floors

        Front partitioning
